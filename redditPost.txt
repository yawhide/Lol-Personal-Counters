please be nice to my little server :(

Hello,

I made a website for the 2016 riot api challenge and I would like to share it to the masses! My website gets your [Pre]Season 6 ranked games and figures out who you played against and whether you won or lost. <enter>
<enter>
On the main page, you enter your summoner name, your region, your lane, and finally, your enemy champion. My website will then tell you your personal winrate against that enemy (in said lane) and also show you the champion.gg win rates for that particular matchup. My friends and I have been using this website for awhile and it has become a ritual to use it in champion select. <enter>
<enter>
I have limited the number of ranked games it looks at to 30 games / 6hrs (to help with any high load usage and to combat the riot api rate limit) and only [Pre]Season 6. If all goes well, I'll up the limit. <enter>
<enter>
Feedback is always welcome and please do not hesitate to comment on anything you dislike or like! I have a list of things I want to add but there are lots of things I haven't thought of so please share. <enter>
<enter>
If the website doesn't load it means there are too many people checking the site out so please try again later!<enter>
